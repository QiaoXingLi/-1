This repo contains rants &amp; ramblings, disguised as codes of sorts written with consummate elegance, from a low key dewy-eyed coder & a halfwit researcher carrying sublime low esteem and absolutely **-1** idea what he's doing with his life or career. 

To illustrate the scenario a bit, every time I run the following command:

```~$ grep -c -R -e "soul" -e "hope" -e "expectation" -e "will-to-live" /home/SaadAAkash```

The shell always returns:

```~$ 0```
